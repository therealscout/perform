                        49 CFR 40.25 (j) â€“ As the employer you must also ask the employee whether he or she has tested positive, or refused to test, on
                        any pre-employment drug or alcohol test administered by an employer to which the employee applied for, but did not obtain,
                        safety-sensitive transportation work covered by DOT agency drug and alcohol testing rules during the past two years. If the
                        employee admits that he or she had a positive test or a refusal to test, you must not use the employee to perform safety-
                        sensitive functions for you, until and unless the employee documents successful completion of the return-to-duty process. (See
                        49 CFR 40.25 (b) (5) and (e))
