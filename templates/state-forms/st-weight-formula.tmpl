                <p>
                    This truck (serial # {{ .vehicle.VIN }}) is needing a <br>
                    combination weight rating (GCWR) to pull trailers over 10,000 lbs.
                    <br>
                    The original vehicle manufacturer did not have one set. The Bureau of
                    <br>
                    Motor Vehicles in 1987 made a formula to calculate the GCWR for trucks
                    <br>
                    that did not have it on the MSO.
                    <br>
                    The Bureau uses this in order to properly title vehicles so that they comply
                    <br>
                    with sections 1304 (3) (d) and 4942 (c) of the vehicle code.
                    <br>
                    This is the calculation for this truck:
                </p>
                <p>
                    GVWR + (9 x (gross - unladen weight)) = GCWR
                </p>
                <p>
                    {{ .vehicle.GVW }} + (9 x ({{ .vehicle.GVW}} - {{ .vehicle.UnladenWeight}})) = {{ .vehicle.GCR }}
                </p>

                <p>
                    WE WISH ONLY TO LIST THIS TRUCK AT GCWR OF {{ .vehicle.GCR }} LBS
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for your help.
